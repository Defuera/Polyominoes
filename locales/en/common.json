    "intro": "A polyomino is a shape made by joining squares edge-to-edge. The name comes from \"domino\" - remember those game pieces? A domino is made of 2 squares!",
    "funFactTetris": "The famous game Tetris uses tetrominoes (4-square shapes). There are exactly 5 different tetrominoes, but Tetris only uses 4 of them in most versions!",

    "historyTitle": "The History",
    "historyP1": "Polyominoes were first studied by Solomon Golomb in 1953. He was a mathematician at the University of Southern California who loved puzzles. He invented the name \"polyomino\" and discovered many cool properties about these shapes.",
    "historyP2": "The concept became super popular when Martin Gardner wrote about it in his \"Mathematical Games\" column in Scientific American magazine in the 1950s and 1960s. Millions of people got hooked on polyomino puzzles!",
    "mathTitle": "Why It's Important in Mathematics",
    "combinatorics": "Combinatorics",
    "combinatoricsText": "Polyominoes help us learn about counting in mathematics. The big question is: \"How many unique N-square polyominoes exist?\" This is harder than it sounds! Mathematicians still don't have a simple formula that works for all N.",
    "symmetry": "Symmetry and Transformations",
    "symmetryText": "When counting polyominoes, we have to decide: are shapes that are rotated or flipped versions of each other \"the same\"? This teaches us about geometric transformations - rotating, reflecting, and moving shapes around.",
    "tessellation": "Tessellation and Tiling",
    "tessellationText": "A famous puzzle is: can you use all 12 pentominoes (5-square shapes) to tile a rectangle? Yes! They perfectly fill a 6×10 or 5×12 rectangle. This connects to real problems in design and manufacturing.",
    "applicationsTitle": "Real-World Applications",
    "videoGames": "🎮 Video Games",
    "videoGamesText": "Tetris is the most famous example - it's one of the best-selling games ever! The shapes you rotate and place are tetrominoes.",

    "packingText": "How do you fit the most packages in a truck? Or arrange products on a shelf? These are similar to polyomino puzzles and help companies save space and money.",

    "chemistryText": "Molecules can have shapes similar to polyominoes. Understanding how shapes fit together helps chemists predict how molecules will behave.",
    "art": "🎨 Art and Design",
    "artText": "Artists and designers use polyomino-like patterns to create tessellations, quilts, tile floors, and digital art.",
    "computerScience": "💻 Computer Science",
    "computerScienceText": "Generating all polyominoes is a great problem for learning about algorithms - step-by-step instructions computers follow. It teaches about recursion (when something refers to itself) and optimization (making things faster).",
    "challengeTitle": "Challenge:",
    "challengeText": "Nobody knows a simple formula for counting polyominoes! For N=1 through 6, we know the answers (1, 1, 2, 5, 12, 35). But for large N, we have to use computers to count them. For N=24, there are more than 200 billion billion different polyominoes!",
